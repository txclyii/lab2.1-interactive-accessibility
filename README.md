Reflection Questions:

- What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
  <br>
  For me, it was understanding ARIA elements. The concept of ARIA is still very new to me, and when I was learning HTML and CSS a long time ago, I was not taught to use elements like `aria-label=""`, etc. Even on my other assignment, I had to constantly check to see if
  my forms were labeled correctly for anything ARIA-related.
  
- How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
  <br>
  If a user is visually-impaired, they rely on assistive technologies like a screen reader. Using a screen reader on a website can be quite difficult if the website is not coded for accessibility, resulting to possibly important information being left out for the user. The
  user might also find it difficult to navigate around the website as well.
  
- What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
  <br>
  I used the tool that Per Scholas has linked in the assignment. It is called [WebAIM: Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
